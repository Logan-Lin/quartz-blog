- This is the source code of my personal blog. The content/ folder contains the raw content of each blog post in markdown, and the rest of the code is for automatically generating a static website page displaying the posts
- The blog posts under content/ai-system/ are served as literature for a course I am teaching. When planning and writing content for these posts, note that 1) the target audience of this course is non-CS folks, 2) the content should be straight-forward and intuitive while not compromising professionalism, 3) the index page of these posts provide a list of all the modules (and corresponding posts) in the course in order, you can check the content in previous modules when writing for a new module for reference
