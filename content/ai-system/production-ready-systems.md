Now you can deploy your AI system on different hardware infrastructures with ease, and also enable everyone in the world to access (and hopefully pay for) your AI services. Now you won't run into situations where your friends are calling you to play CS2 but your laptop is running an AI service so you cannot.

However, in real-world production environments, we might encounter challenges that our existing knowledge cannot effectively handle. For one, machines can break and so do the AI systems running on those machines. You probably do not want a phone call from your boss telling you the company's whole service goes down to ruin your weekend. On the other hand, you might want to introduce update to a running AI system at some point, but your boss tell you that you cannot just stop the current system and start the new one, since this 5 seconds service interruption will cause the company millions.

In answer to these, in this final phase of the course, we will explore some advanced techniques that make your AI system more robust to unforeseen interruptions, and can handle challenging needs in real-world deployment.
