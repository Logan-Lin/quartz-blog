I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University. I received my PhD and Bachelor's degrees from Beijing Jiaotong University, China. My research interests include _spatiotemporal data mining_, _representation learning_, and _AI for science_. I am also personally interested in full-stack development and tinkering with hardware. To learn more about me, you are welcome to check out my homepage--link in the footer.

This is my personal blog where I occasionally post my thoughts and findings during research.
